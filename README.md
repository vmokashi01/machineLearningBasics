# machineLearningBasics

I am using this space to keep track of small projects, courses, and tutorials I have followed to develop fundamental machine learning competences. So far this includes code created as part of my pathway to learning ML concepts (mini-projects and Kaggle tutorials) as well as problem sets and notes from Andrew Ng's CS 229 cours used to build thorough mathematical intuition. 

Topics covered: 
- Supervised Learning
  - Linear Regression (L1/L2-regularized; Ridge, Lasso, ElasticNet) 
  - LMS/ Widrow-Hoff update rule
  - Gradient Descent (Batch, Stochastic)
  - Normal Equation (and its derivation)
  - Probabilistic Interpreations of Linear and Logistic Regression (Maximum Likelihood, Log Likelihood)
  - Locally Weighted Linear Regression
  - Logistic Regression/Sigmoid Function (Binary Classification, One-Vs-All)
